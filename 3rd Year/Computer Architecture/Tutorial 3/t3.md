# Question 3

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz, 2901 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)

Function Call Time: 0.4147ms

My approach was to run the Ackermann function a large amount of times then find the average. I believed that this would give the most
accurate result as running it once would lose precision in how accurate the cpp clock implimentation would be on my cpu. Then finding the
average of this larger time could give an accurate one. It was also essential to disable optimization in visual studio as otherwise the extra 
function calls would be optimised away and the function would be over in nanoseconds. I believe this is quite accurate but obviously accuracy is lost
due to incrementing the count in the while loop and the variable comparison.
